# Evaluating the Architecture Pattern
## Does This Follow Microkernel Architecture?
The Microkernel Architecture consists of:
1. A core system handling minimal functionalities.
2. Plugins extending behavior dynamically.

✔ This Framework Matches Microkernel Architecture
1. Core (Microkernel) → Celery as the core task execution engine.
2. Plugins → Task extensions via decorators and pluggy.
3. Dependency Injection → Provides flexibility in extending services.
4. FastAPI as a Wrapper → Exposes Celery via APIs.

✅ Microkernel-like Characteristics
1. Feature	Implementation
2. Minimal Core	Celery provides basic task execution
3. Plugin Extensions pluggy allows dynamic task extension
4. Dynamic Dependency Injection:	dependency-injector injects services
5. Loosely Coupled Components: Tasks are defined without Celery-specific code

## Alternative: Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
If each Celery task is deployed as an independent microservice, it would resemble SOA or Microservices.
If we expose Celery tasks via event-driven RabbitMQ, it leans toward Event-Driven Architecture (EDA).

✅ Best Fit: Microkernel Architecture + Event-Driven Extensions


### Kubernetes
```commandline
#### Traditional Celery Setup (Monolithic)
services:
  celery_worker:
    build: .
    command: celery -A tasks worker --loglevel=info

```

#### Microservices-Based Celery Setup
1. Each Celery task is a separate microservice.
2. Each task has its own codebase, deployment, and lifecycle.
3. RabbitMQ (or Kafka) acts as an event bus, triggering tasks independently.
4. Tasks scale independently based on demand.

```commandline
services:
  task_1_service:
    build: .
    command: celery -A task1 worker --loglevel=info

  task_2_service:
    build: .
    command: celery -A task2 worker --loglevel=info

```

Deploying Celery Tasks as Microservices with Kubernetes
Each Celery task is deployed independently in Kubernetes.

### Kubernetes Deployment for task1_service

```commandline
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: task1-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: task1-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: task1-service
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: task1
        image: myrepo/task1-service
        command: ["celery", "-A", "task1", "worker", "--loglevel=info"]

```
